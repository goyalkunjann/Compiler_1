# <Project Name> Compiler

## Description
This project is a web-based compiler designed to compile and execute code snippets in <programming language(s)>. Leveraging the MERN stack, it features a React frontend, Node.js and Express backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The compiler aims to provide a seamless development and testing environment for <target audience>.

## Architecture
The application is divided into two main components:
- **Frontend**: Developed with React, offering a user interface for submitting code, viewing results, and managing user sessions.
- **Backend**: Implemented with Node.js and Express, responsible for code compilation, execution, and interacting with the MongoDB database.

MongoDB stores user information, code submissions, and execution results, facilitating a robust and scalable data management solution.

## Features
- Supports code compilation and execution for C++.
- Provides real-time feedback on code execution.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest Stable Version)
- MongoDB (Latest Stable Version)
